    "## GATHER\n",
    "There are three sources used to gather data for this project: WeRateDogs Twitter archive, image predictions, Twitter API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WeRateDogs Twitter Archive\n",
    "This dataset is provided by Udacity as a CSV file and is available for download. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive was loaded in using pandas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Predictions\n",
    "This dataset is hosted on Udacity's server and was downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and loaded using pandas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Twitter API\n",
    "The retweet and favorite count for each tweet in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive was gathered by querying the Twitter API using Tweepy. Since I wasnâ€™t granted with a Twitter developer account, this data was provided by Udacity and was downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and loaded using pandas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ASSESS\n",
    "Each  of the three datasets gathered were assessed by its quality and tidiness. Findings are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### WeRateDogs Twitter Archive\n",
    ">**QUALITY**\n",
    "- Incorrect data types for `tweet_id`, `timestamp`, columns\n",
    "- Missing names, incorrect name tagged\n",
    "- Replies and retweets included in dataset\n",
    "- `text` includes link\n",
    "- Incorrect extracted ratings (416, 878, 1407, 2054)\n",
    "- Maximum for `rating_denominator` 170\n",
    "- Missing values for `doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper`, `puppo` represented as string '*None*'\n",
    "\n",
    ">**TIDINESS**\n",
    "- Separate columns for dog levels(`doggo`, `pupper`, `puppo`, `floofer`) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Predictions\n",
    ">**QUALITY**\n",
    "- Incorrect data type for `tweet_id`\n",
    "- Dog breed capitalization\n",
    "\n",
    ">**TIDINESS**\n",
    "- Multiple columns for breed predictions\n",
    "- Can be merged with twitter archive dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Twitter API\n",
    ">**QUALITY**\n",
    "- Incorrect data type for `tweet_id`\n",
    "\n",
    ">**TIDINESS**\n",
    "- Can be merged with twitter archive dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## CLEAN\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Values\n",
    "**Missing names, incorrect name tagged**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Repopulate `name` column using for loop, if statements, and combination of string methods to extract name. Strings *'name is', 'named', 'This is', 'Meet', and 'hello to'* are typically used before introducing the name. Texts not meeting the condition will be populated as null. (*Missing names issue addressed here*)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing values for `doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper`, `puppo` represented as string '*None*'**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Extract dog stage from  `text` column using *doggo, Doggo, puppo, Puppo, pupper, floofer, Floofer*, return corresponding dog stage, otherwise, return null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness\n",
    "**Separate columns for dog levels(`doggo`, `pupper`, `puppo`, `floofer`)**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Create a new column, `dog_stage`, to identify the dog level for each row using the `doggo`, `pupper`, `puppo`, `floofer`. If there are two classifications, return string \"*multiple*\". Drop the `doggo`, `pupper`, `puppo`, `floofer` columns once new column is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple columns for breed predictions**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Create one column for the predicted breed. To identify the predicted breed, we'll choose the most confident prediction given the prediction is a breed of dog. 'False' predictions will be tagged as NaN, using for and if loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merge all three datasets**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Merge all three tables on unique identifier, tweet_id, using pd.merge() method..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality\n",
    "**Incorrect data types**\n",
    ">Convert the following columns to correct data types:\n",
    "- `tweet_id`, `dog_level`, `predicted_breed` to category\n",
    "- `timestamp` to datetime\n",
    "- `retweet_count`, `favorite_count` to int\n",
    "\n",
    "**Replies and retweets included in dataset**\n",
    ">Drop rows for retweets and replies by extracting non-null values under the `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id` and `retweeted_status` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`text` column includes link**\n",
    ">Find string '*https:*' and extract all strings before it using .find() method and loop functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Assessment: Incorrect extracted ratings (416, 878, 969, 1407, 2054)**\n",
    ">Ratings for rows 416, 878, 1407, 2054 are incorrect. Check the text for each row and update ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximum observation for`rating_denominator`is 170**\n",
    ">A `rating_denominator` of more than 10 refer to more than 1 dog which was typically multiplied by the number of dogs. To standardize, we'll divide the rating to the number of dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drop irrelevant columns**\n",
    ">Drop columns `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `source`, `retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FINAL RESULT\n",
    "The combined and cleaned dataset now consists of 1971 rows with 12 columns."
